# ideaCentre-FYP
My Final Year Project, 'ideaCentre'. This project is an app that allows you to record musical ideas / sounds on both Android and iOS devices, which are then automatically uploaded to the ideaCentre website. From here you can download audio and drag it straight into your Digital Audio Workstation.
